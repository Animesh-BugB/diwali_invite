# How to Style Your Google Form to Match Your Website

## ⚠️ Important Note

You **CANNOT** style Google Form content directly from your website due to browser security (iframe cross-origin restrictions). 

**BUT** you can customize the form's appearance from within Google Forms itself!

## 🎨 Alternative: Minimalist Approach

If you want the form to completely blend in:

### Ultra-Minimal Settings:
- **Header Color:** `#f5f0e8` (same as background - invisible header)
- **Background:** `#f5f0e8` (cream)
- **No header image**
- **Font:** Basic

This makes the form look like a seamless part of your website!

## 🔧 What I've Already Done for the Container

I've updated your `style.css` to:
- Add a subtle maroon border around the form
- Add shadow for depth
- Set transparent background so form shows through
- Improved spacing

The container now matches your website better, but the **form content itself must be styled from within Google Forms**.

## 📱 Current Limitations

**What you CAN'T change from your website:**
- ❌ Font inside the form
- ❌ Input field colors
- ❌ Button colors
